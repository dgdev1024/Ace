# Prompt

Let's move on to "4. Asset Management". In addition to the goals, milestones and
tasks you provided in that chapter, also include goals, milestones and tasks related
to loading assets from loose files, compressed asset bundles and other potential
sources, using a centralized virtual filesystem (VFS).

# Response

Below is the **deep‑dive** for **Asset Management** in your Ace engine—expanded to cover **loose files**, **compressed asset bundles**, and a **centralized virtual filesystem (VFS)**. We’ll break it into:

1. **Goals & Milestones**

3. **Sub‑systems & Implementation Steps**

   1. Virtual File System (VFS)
   2. Asset Loaders & Registry
   3. Loose‑File Loading
   4. Compressed Bundle Support
   5. Background Streaming & Threading
   6. Hot‑Reload & File Watching
4. **Example Development Prompts**

## 1. Goals & Milestones

### Goals

* **Uniform Access**: All assets—whether loose on disk, inside a zip/pack file, or downloaded over network—are opened via a single VFS interface.
* **Modularity**: Loaders for textures, models, audio, scripts, etc., plug into the VFS seamlessly.
* **Streaming**: Large assets (big textures, audio streams) load in background without blocking main thread.
* **Caching & Lifetime**: Assets automatically reference‑counted, de‑duplicated, and unloaded when unused.
* **Hot‑Reload**: In debug/editor builds, updates to loose files or bundles immediately reload assets.

### Milestones

1. **M1**: Design & implement **VFS** API with support for mounting loose directories.
2. **M2**: Build an **AssetLoader** interface + **AssetRegistry** for generic load/cache/unload.
3. **M3**: Implement **loose-file loaders** (PNG, WAV, etc.) via VFS file handles.
4. **M4**: Add **compressed bundle** support (e.g. ZIP, pak) as a mountable VFS layer.
5. **M5**: Integrate **background streaming** via thread pool + futures.
6. **M6**: Wire up **hot-reload**: file‑watcher notifications trigger asset invalidation & reload.

                             |

```

* **VFS**: central “mount table” mapping logical paths to real sources (dirs, zip archives, remote).
* **AssetRegistry**: caches loaded assets (keyed by logical path + type), returns shared handles.
* **AssetLoader<T>**: templated interface for each asset type (images, meshes, sounds).

## 3. Sub‑systems & Implementation Steps

### 3.1 Virtual File System (VFS)

**Tasks**

* Define `class VFS { … }` with methods:

  * `bool MountDirectory(const std::string& mountPoint, const std::filesystem::path& realPath);`
  * `bool MountArchive(const std::string& mountPoint, const std::filesystem::path& archivePath);`
  * `std::unique_ptr<IVfsFile> Open(const std::string& logicalPath);`
* `IVfsFile` abstracts `read`, `seek`, `size`, `tell`, `close`.
* Internally maintain a list of mounts: each mount has a type (directory vs archive) and handles resolution in LIFO order.

**Milestone M1**

* Mounting loose directories only.
* `Open` resolves `mountPoint + "/" + logicalPath` to a file on disk.

### 3.2 AssetLoader Interface & Registry

**Tasks**

* `template<typename T> struct IAssetLoader { virtual T Load( std::unique_ptr<IVfsFile> ); };`
* `class AssetRegistry {`

  * `template<typename T> AssetHandle<T> Load(const std::string& path);`
  * Internally: check `cache[path]`, if present return handle, else:

    1. `auto file = VFS::Open(path);`
    2. `T asset = loader.Load(std::move(file));`
    3. Store `shared_ptr<T>` in cache, return `AssetHandle<T>`
* Use `std::shared_ptr` for lifetime, `weak_ptr` for cache entries that expire when no handles remain.

**Milestone M2**

* Implement registry and loader for one type (e.g. `Texture2D`).

### 3.3 Loose‑File Loading

**Tasks**

* For each asset type: use existing libraries via VFS file handles:

  * **Images**: `.png/.jpg` → stbi\_load from memory buffer read via VFS.
  * **Audio**: `.wav/.ogg` → dr\_wav/dr\_mp3 from file buffer.
  * **Models**: `.obj/.fbx` → tinyobj or FBX SDK.
* Load synchronously for small assets; test registry cache.

**Milestone M3**

* Synchronous loading from loose files only.

### 3.4 Compressed Bundle Support

**Tasks**

* Integrate a ZIP‑reading library (miniz, PhysFS, libzip).
* Implement `VfsArchive` mount type: on `Open`, look up file in zip central directory, return a memory stream.
* Allow multiple archives mounted at different mount points; logical paths override order.

**Milestone M4**

* Ability to mount `game.pak` and load assets from it seamlessly, or fall back to loose if not found.

### 3.5 Background Streaming & Threading

**Tasks**

* Extend `AssetRegistry::LoadAsync<T>(path)` returning `std::future<AssetHandle<T>>`.
* Internally push load tasks into a `ThreadPool` (e.g. `std::async` or custom pool).
* Ensure only one load per path is in flight: if concurrent requests, return same future or wait on ongoing load.

**Milestone M5**

* Streaming of large textures/meshes off main thread, with callbacks on completion.

### 3.6 Hot‑Reload & File Watching

**Tasks**

* Use platform file‑watcher (inotify, ReadDirectoryChangesW, FSEvents) to detect loose file changes.
* On change:

  1. Invalidate cache entry: move to “dirty” list.
  2. Notify listeners via `EventBus::Emit<AssetChanged>(path)`.
  3. On next `Load`, reload from disk or archive.
* In editor builds, trigger immediate reload of in‑use assets (textures, scripts).

**Milestone M6**

* Live‑reload materials/meshes when source files change in editor.

## 4. Example Development Prompts

* **VFS Mounting**

  > “Generate a header‑only `VFS` class that supports mounting directories and looking up files by logical path, returning a `std::istream`‑like interface.”
* **ZIP Archive Support**

  > “Show me how to integrate `miniz` into `VFS` as an archive mount, exposing `Open()` that reads compressed file entries.”
* **AssetRegistry & Loader**

  > “Write `AssetRegistry::Load<Texture2D>` that uses `VFS::Open` + `stb_image.h` to load PNGs into GPU textures, with `std::shared_ptr` caching.”
* **Async Loading**

  > “Implement `AssetRegistry::LoadAsync<T>` using a `ThreadPool` and `std::promise` so callers can `co_await` or `.get()` the result.”
* **Hot‑Reload**

  > “Demonstrate how to watch a directory for changes using `inotify` on Linux and emit a `FileChanged` event into `EventBus`.”

With this expanded roadmap, you’ll have a robust asset pipeline capable of handling everything from loose development files to packed, streaming, and live‑reloaded resources—foundational for both runtime and editor workflows.
